A.
There are several ways that leveraging an IS solution can help Soleil Panel Distribution achieve operational efficiency. Perhaps the most obvious way is by automating certain tasks that are currently being done manually. For example, if Soleil Panel Distribution is currently manually inputting data into their accounting system, investing in an automated data entry solution can save a significant amount of time and effort. In addition, an IS solution can help Soleil Panel Distribution streamline their processes and procedures. By implementing a standardized system, Soleil Panel Distribution can ensure that everyone is following the same procedures and that tasks are being completed in the most efficient way possible. Finally, an IS solution can provide visibility into the organization's operations, allowing Soleil Panel Distribution to identify areas where they can improve their efficiency.

Business process management (BPM) can help the IT department in the development of SolDistHR in several ways. First, BPM can help to define the business processes that are required to support the SolDistHR system. This will help to ensure that the system is designed to support the business processes that are required to make the system effective. Additionally, BPM can help to monitor and optimize the business processes that are associated with SolDistHR system. This will help to ensure that the system is operating effectively and efficiently. Finally, BPM can help to identify and resolve any issues that may arise with the SolDistHR system. This will help to ensure that the system is able to meet the needs of the business.

I.	Defining the problem: The first step in change management is to clearly define the problem that needs to be addressed. In the case of the development of a new software application called SolDistHR, the problem that needs to be addressed is the inefficient management of information system of Soleil Panel Distribution Company.
II.	Analyzing the current situation: The second step is to analyze the current situation in order to identify the root causes of the problem. In the case of SolDistHR, the root causes of the problem are the lack of an effective information management system and the lack of trained personnel to operate the system.
III.	Developing a plan of action: The third step is to develop a plan of action that will address the root causes of the problem. In the case of SolDistHR, the plan of action should include the development of an effective information management system and the training of personnel to operate the system.
IV.	Implementing the plan of action: The fourth step is to implement the plan of action. In the case of SolDistHR, this would involve the development of the software application and the training of personnel.
V.	Evaluating the results: The fifth and final step is to evaluate the results of the implementation of the plan of action. In the case of SolDistHR, this would involve assessing the effectiveness of the information management system and the training of personnel.

The four key contributors that would be directly involved in the development of the new software application SolDistHR are the project manager, software developers, testing team, and the company's management.
The project manager is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and success of the project. They will work with the software developers to create a project plan and timeline and will be responsible for ensuring that the project stays on track. The project manager will also be responsible for communication with the company's management team, as well as coordinating with the testing team to ensure that the software meets all requirements.
The software developers will be responsible for the actual development of the software. They will work with the project manager to create the project plan and timeline and will be responsible for coding the software and ensuring that it meets all requirements.
The testing team will be responsible for testing the software to ensure that it meets all requirements. They will work with the project manager and software developers to create a testing plan and will be responsible for executing the tests and reporting the results.
The company's management team will be responsible for approving the project and providing funding. They will also be responsible for communication with the project manager and reviewing the project plan and timeline.

B
Agile methodology is preferred
1.	The system development method that I would recommend for use in the implementation of SolDistHR would be the Agile methodology. This methodology is well-suited for software development projects that are likely to experience changes during the course of development, as is often the case with new applications. With Agile, development is done in short cycles, or "sprints," which allows for more flexibility and adaptability as changes arise. Additionally, Agile places a strong emphasis on collaboration between developers and stakeholders, which is essential for ensuring that the final product meets the needs of the users. Agile methodology is preferred, it relies heavily on teamwork and collaboration, which can be difficult to achieve if team members are not well-trained or experienced in working together. In addition, the iterative nature of agile methodology can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration if team members are not clear on the overall goal or objectives of the project.

2.
The initial step in the agile methodology is the requirements gathering phase. In this phase, the team will gather all the requirements for the new software application. This includes understanding the business needs of the company and the specific requirements of the users.
The second milestone is the design phase. In this phase, the team will design the software application according to the requirements gathered in the previous phase. This includes creating the user interface, database, and other components of the software.
The third phase is the development phase. In this phase, the team will develop the software according to the design created in the previous phase. In this phase the prototype of SolDistHR will be created based on the requirements gathered from the stakeholders. This includes coding the software, testing it, and fixing any bugs. 
The fourth milestone is the deployment phase. In this phase, the team will deploy the software to the users. This includes installing the software on the user's computers, providing training to the users, and making sure the software is working properly.
The last milestone is the maintenance phase. In this phase, the team will provide support to the users and make sure the software is up to date. This includes fixing any bugs that are found, adding new features, and providing customer support.

The potential internal security threats that could exist after the implementation of SolDistHR system designed to help in management of information system of Soleil Panel Distribution Company are:
I.	Insiders with malicious intent could misuse the system to gain access to confidential data or to disrupt operations.
II.	Poorly designed or implemented security controls could allow unauthorized access to the system or data.
III.	Lack of security awareness among employees could lead to careless handling of sensitive information, which could lead to its leakage.
The potential external security threats that could exist after the implementation of SolDistHR are:
IV.	Hackers could target the system to gain access to confidential data or to disrupt operations.
V.	Malware could be used to infect the system and allow unauthorized access to data or to take control of operations.
VI.	Spammers could use the system to send large volumes of unsolicited emails, which could overload the system and cause it to crash.

D
To protect against digital and physical threats that could exist after the implementation of the SolDistHR system, the following security measures should be put in place:
I.	 Access control: Only authorized personnel should be allowed to access the system and its data. This can be achieved using passwords, user IDs, and/or biometric authentication.
II.	 Data encryption: SolDistHR should encrypt all data stored on the system, as well as any data that is transmitted over the network. This will make it more difficult for hackers to access and/or steal the data.
III.	Firewalls: A firewall should be used to protect the system from outside attacks.
IV.	Intrusion detection/prevention: Intrusion detection and prevention systems can be used to detect and/or prevent unauthorized access to the system.
V.	Physical security: SolDistHR should be installed in a secure location with limited physical access. In addition, the system should be backed up in a secure location in case of physical damage to the system.


E
The approach I would take to troubleshoot and restore a new system called SolDistHR would involve the following steps:
a.	Identify the problem: The first step would be to identify the problem with the new system. This could involve talking to users of the system to see what issues they are having or looking at system logs to see what errors are being generated.
b.	Isolate the problem: Once the problem has been identified, the next step would be to isolate it so that it can be fixed. This could involve restarting the system or running diagnostic tests to identify the cause of the problem.
c.	Fix the problem: The next step would be to fix the problem. This could involve code changes, configuration changes, or other steps necessary to resolve the issue.
d.	Test the fix: Once the problem has been fixed, it is important to test the fix to ensure that it works as expected and that the system is functioning correctly.
e.	Deploy the fix: The final step would be to deploy the fix to the live system so that users can start using the system again.

The purpose of problem management is to identify, investigate, and resolve problems that occur within the IT infrastructure. Problem management is a proactive process that works to prevent problems from occurring and reduce the impact of those that do occur. The goal of problem management is to minimize the negative impact of incidents and problems on the business.
When a new system is introduced, there is always a risk that problems will occur. Problem management can help to identify and resolve these problems before they cause significant impact. In the case of SolDistHR, problem management can help to ensure that the new system is functioning properly and that any problems that do occur are quickly resolved. This can help to minimize the disruption to the business and ensure that the new system is successfully adopted.
G
Incident management is a process used to identify, document, and resolve incidents. The goal of incident management is to return the system to normal operation as quickly as possible with minimal impact on the business (Palilingan & Batmetan, 2018). The steps that I would take in relation to incident management to address current problems and mitigate future issues would include:



a)	Identify the incident:
There are several potential incidents that could occur with the SolDistHR system. Examples include the system going down, data being corrupted, or users not being able to access the system.
b)	Prioritize the incident:
The priority of the incident will be based on the severity of the issue and the impact it has on the business. For example, if the system goes down, this would be a high priority as it would prevent employees from being able to do their job.
c)	Escalate the incident:
The incident will be escalated to the appropriate team who will then work to resolve the issue.
d)	Communicate the incident:
Once the incident has been escalated, the team will need to communicate the issue to the relevant stakeholders. This will ensure that everyone is aware of the problem and the steps that are being taken to resolve it.
e)	Resolve the incident:
The team will work to resolve the incident as quickly as possible. This may involve troubleshooting the system, restoring data, or providing workarounds for users.


f)	Prevent future incidents:
Once the incident has been resolved, the team will investigate the root cause and put in place measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. This could involve changes to the system, additional training for users, or improved processes. Learning from the incidence is also key. This includes documenting what happened and what could be done to prevent it from happening again.
